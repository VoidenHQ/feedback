## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues in existing code
- **New features** - Add new functionality to the app
- **Documentation** - Improve README, add examples, write guides (see [Voiden Docs Repository](https://github.com/VoidenHQ/docs))
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage

### Before You Start

1. Check if an issue already exists for what you want to work on
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal
3. For bug fixes, search existing issues or create a new one
4. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/beta
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding guidelines below

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   yarn test:ui
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new API for custom panels"
   ```

   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding or updating tests

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository

7. **Address review feedback** - Be responsive to comments and requested changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix
- Include a clear description of what the PR does
- Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Update documentation if you're changing APIs
- Add examples if introducing new features
- Ensure all checks pass before requesting review

### Branch Naming

- Features: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Bug Fixes: `bugfix/[bug-name]`

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Provide explicit type annotations for public APIs
- Use interfaces for public types
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Export only what's necessary for the public API
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain consistent file structure

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to all public classes, methods, and types
- Include `@example` tags showing usage
- Document parameters with `@param` and return values with `@returns`
- Keep comments up-to-date when changing code
