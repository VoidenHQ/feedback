# 🌀 Voiden : Devoid of Chaos

### *Built for speed. Designed for sanity.*

---

Ever stared into the bleak, yawning abyss of a 500-line OpenAPI spec and thought,
**“There must be a better way…”**

**There is. It’s called Voiden.**
And it’s not an abyss. It’s a launchpad.

Voiden isn’t just another tool—it’s the *everything shower* of API work. Design? Check. Test? Of course. Docs? You bet your trailing slashes. Built on **Git**, powered by **Markdown**, and held together with reusable, snap-together blocks that’d make LEGO jealous—Void is your new favorite playground for building delightful APIs without losing your mind.

Oh, and we do **OpenAPI linting**, so your specs are cleaner than your browser history in incognito mode.
And yes—we **import your dusty old Postman collections** too, so nothing (and we mean *nothing*) gets left behind.

---

## 🧠 From Chaos to Composable: Build APIs Like a Human

Voiden takes your YAML-fueled existential dread and replaces it with… joy?
Yes. **Joy.** A visual API editor that’s actually nice to use. No cryptic indents. No 90s enterprise vibes. Just clean blocks and a UI that doesn’t hate you.

### ✨ Everything’s a Block

* Need a new endpoint? Drop in an `` `/endpoint` ``.

* Writing tests? Reuse that same endpoint block—no copy-pasting spaghetti.

* Want it in your docs? **Boom**, it’s already there.

Voiden lets you build APIs like you’re composing a playlist. No stale examples. No broken links. Just structured, synced, beautiful harmony.

---

## 🧪 Testing: Now With 86% More Swagger (And Probably a Hat)

Testing in Voiden is less "ugh" and more "oh heck yeah."
Every endpoint is reusable in your tests. Every test is automatable.
You can literally `@import` your way to glory. Build workflows that chain together requests, check responses, and slide right into your CI/CD like a boss.

> Bonus: You can **run lint checks on OpenAPI** directly in the editor.
> Because if your spec has typos, it’s not a spec—it’s a trap.

---

## 🛠️ Git-Native: Because Your API *Is* Code

Voiden treats your API like a first-class code citizen.
Branches? Merges? Pull requests? It’s all in there.

Need to review changes to your docs? Git diff it.
Want to revert a rogue update? Git checkout, baby.

You can even see how your Markdown-backed blocks evolved over time.
No more playing “Who deleted the body param?” during standup.

---

## 📥 Postman? Bring It. We’ll Make It Better.

We get it. You’ve been using Postman for a decade, and half your test suite lives in that orange tab you forgot to save.

Voiden imports it.
Cleanly.
Elegantly.
**And then lets you build on it** with reusable blocks and proper version control.

It’s like giving your old collection a spa day and a full makeover.

---

## 📚 Docs That Write Themselves (Almost)

Void’s docs aren’t an afterthought—they’re just… there. Automatically.
Design an API, write a bit of markdown, maybe throw in a table or code block, and suddenly you’ve got docs that don’t suck.

Everything stays in sync because it’s the *same source*.
No more stale sample responses or “oh crap we forgot to update the docs” moments. Just fresh, delicious documentation served right from the kitchen.

---

## 🧱 Blocks, Baby. Blocks.

Voiden is powered by **Voiden Blocks**—modular, reusable units of awesomeness.

```
Build your API like it’s modular furniture—except it works, and you don’t have leftover screws.

## 🧪 Environment Variables That Just Work

Switching environments should not require emotional support.
Voiden supports `.env` files and dynamic variables like `{{this}}`, so you can go from dev to staging to prod without rewriting half your requests.

Just pick the environment from a dropdown and go.

---

## ⚡ Extensions: Bring Your Own Superpowers

Void’s got a whole **Extensions panel**—for when the out-of-the-box experience just isn’t enough.
Need a custom plugin? We got you. Want to hook into a third-party service? Sure.
Void’s like your IDE had a growth spurt and joined a rock band.

---

## 🖥️ Built-In Terminal: Because Tabs Are for Amateurs

Why leave your flow to open a terminal?
Voiden has one right there. Run scripts. Ping endpoints. Install stuff.
All without losing your precious momentum. Or your window arrangement.

---

## ✍️ Markdown, But Make It Sexy

Under the hood, Voiden is Markdown-powered. That means:

* Full version control via Git

* Beautiful diffs

* Zero lock-in

* And docs you can actually read in plaintext

It's like Notion, if Notion could run tests and validate OpenAPI specs.

---

## 🚀 Voiden Isn’t Just Another API Tool. It’s a Shift in the Matrix.

You’re not just writing specs—you’re building live, collaborative, version-controlled, linted, tested, documented *systems*.
Voiden combines everything you *wish* API tooling did into one sleek, extensible app.

Whether you're a solo hacker, an enterprise team, or just someone who’s sick of juggling five tools to ship one API—Void is your new best friend.

So what are you waiting for?
